spec:
  # Linking of Specification and Implementation of Persistent Volume 
  # happens via storageClassName.
  #
  # What happens is at run time k8s will search in the cluster for a Persistent Volume with  
  # same storageClassName, access Mode and a storage which can PROVIDE 
  # atleast mentioned amount of memory (in this case it is 1Gi) and establish 
  # linkage between PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume. This Linking 
  # process is called BINDING.
  #
  # This will allow k8s administrator can have multiple mounts like HDD, SSD but 
  # at runtime a matching storageClassName, accessModes and Storage Availability will
  # acquire the Link.
  #
  # This is the Reason why Implementation storage should be Greater than or Equal to 
  # Specification Storage otherwise Linkage will not establish.
